----- CMB114_CW4_Particle_Simulator - README.md document -----

This individual coding project was coded and completed by Jersey Wilden.


-- BUILDING THE CODE --
To use the program, simply open "particle_simulator.py" in Python IDLE, ensuring scipy is installed on your computer.


-- DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM --
The Python file "particle_simulator.py" is a program that simulates the molecular dynamics of Helium atoms.
The atomic weight and radius of this element is taken into consideration when performing calculations.
The user can add a variable amount of particles, clear all of the particles and adjust the temperature in K.
The root mean square speed (vRMS) formula is applied to Helium to determine the maximum temperature of the particles at the current temperature.
The particles collide with both the grey container walls and each other to create a realistic particle simulation.
As particles collide with each other, the number of collisions is displayed live.
The time elapsed is displayed, which starts counting as soon as the initial particles are added.


-- TUTORIAL --
1. Open "particle_simulator.py".
2. Click the "Enter the simulator" button.
3. To add particles, enter an integer into the entry box and click the "Submit" button.
4. To alter the temperature in K: click and drag the scale bar to the desired temperature.
5. To clear all particles: click the "Clear particles" button.
6. To read about the program, click the "About" button on the "Home Page".
7. To go back from a page, click the "Go back" button.
8. To exit the program entirely, click the "Exit" button on the "Home Page".
